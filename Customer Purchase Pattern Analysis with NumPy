#Import the numpy library
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Create a NumPy array with dummy data
# Rows = Customers, Columns = Monthly purchases (Jan to Apr)
purchases = np.array([
    [200, 220, 250, 275],   # Customer 1
    [150, 180, 200, 230],   # Customer 2
    [300, 310, 320, 330],   # Customer 3
    [100, 120, 130, 150]    # Customer 4
])

# Step 2: Total spend per customer
total_spend = purchases.sum(axis=1)
print("Total Spend per Customer:", total_spend)

# Step 3: Average monthly spend per customer
avg_spend = purchases.mean(axis=1)
print("Average Monthly Spend per Customer:", avg_spend)

# Step 4: Average spend per month across all customers
monthly_avg = purchases.mean(axis=0)
print("Monthly Average Spend:", monthly_avg)

# Step 5: Identify high-value customer (who spent the most overall)
highest_spender = np.argmax(total_spend)
print("High-Value Customer ID:", highest_spender + 1)  # +1 for human-friendly indexing

# Step 6: Spending growth from Jan to Apr for each customer
spending_growth = purchases[:, -1] - purchases[:, 0]
